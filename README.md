# ohi-antz-viz

Based on a chat with Shane Saxon of [Open Antz](http://openantz.com), here's a little dataset with breadth (111 attributes) and depth (222 records) for playing with some complex visualization based on scores from the Ocean Health Index (original data repo: <https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohi-global>).

This repo was created in a format for eventually conforming to <http://github.com/datasets> using [OKFN's Core Dataset format](http://data.okfn.org/roadmap/core-datasets).

The latest interactive map visualization of these data, which uses [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com) can be found at <http://ohi-science.nceas.ucsb.edu/ohi-global>.
